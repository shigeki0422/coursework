This is a flight booking web system where users can register them, search and reserve one-way or two-way itinerary and book by providing their credit card information.


ÅEThis project has presentation tier, business tier and persistence tier which were generated by Spring Roo.
The presentation tier is based on jspx. Each parts of web page such as menu and header are implemented as panels and used to make a web page dynamically. 
Controllers for the business tier and entities for the persistence tier are generated by Roo and features of the classes are wired by aspect files which allow developers not to write boring codes such as getter and setter.
The persistence tier uses Hybernote as database.
